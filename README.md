Exercise for interview 

1) Create a local moodle environment with the last moodle version available.
I have installed version 2.6, becouse the version 2.7 should use the PHP 5.4 and latest MySQL. I have got environment with PHP 5.3. 
If it is important i could upgrade my environment and reinstall newest version of Moodle.

2) Create a custom block that renders everywhere in the system once the user is logged in showing this info:
    * Moodle Version (from variable on backend, not as a custom string)
    * PHP Version
    * Logged username, first name, last name and country.
    * User Image
3) Add a new link on the administration block, under advanced features, and when the user clicks on it, then show the same information on a new page as if it were part of moodle.
4) Create a github repo and upload the test there so we can clone it.
